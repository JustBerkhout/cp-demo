# cp-demo Self Balancing Clusters

The scripts in this directory demonstrate Confluent Platform's [Self Balancing Clusters (SBC)](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/kafka/sbc/index.html) features by adding a broker and triggering a rebalance, and failing a broker and triggering self-healing.
Run these scripts after the initial cp-demo start-up completes
